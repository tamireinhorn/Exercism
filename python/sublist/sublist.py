"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Since Python 2 does not have the enum module, the idiomatic way to write
enumerated constants has traditionally been a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).
